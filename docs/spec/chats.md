# Chats

## A turn

**A finished turn,** with tools, a list and code, and a pull request open for the branch. *Unconfirmed.*

## Questions and approvals

- **While the agent waits on a question, what's typed in the composer is the answer,** and the card says so. A plain Allow button would throw the question away. *Unconfirmed.*

**A command waiting to be allowed.** *Unconfirmed.*

## The model and approval mode

- **A new chat keeps the model and how edits are handled, but not Plan or Full access.** Plan belongs to the task at hand, and Full access should be chosen on purpose each time. *Unconfirmed.*
- **The model picker offers aliases:** `default`, `fable`, `opus`, `sonnet` and `haiku`. They follow the CLI's newest of each without a release here. *Unconfirmed.*

**The approval mode's menu, open.** *Unconfirmed.*

## Closing chats, and keys

- **Closing a chat stops its agent and keeps its history.** Closing the last one starts a new one rather than leaving nothing, and a workspace's first chat is found or made by the hub, so two clients opening a workspace at once share one chat. *Unconfirmed.*
- **Chat keys are the ones tabs use elsewhere:** `Cmd-T` for a new chat, `Cmd-W` to close one, and `Ctrl-Tab` and `Ctrl-Shift-Tab` to move between them. *Unconfirmed.*
